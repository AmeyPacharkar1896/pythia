# 🔮 Pythia: The Oracle Filesystem

> *“Files that don't just store data—they generate it.”*

Pythia is an experimental "Generative Filesystem" that uses **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash** to create content on-the-fly. Instead of writing code manually, you simply create an empty file, rename it to your prompt (e.g., `Snake_Game.py`), and Pythia instantly fills it with working code.

It feels less like coding and more like summoning data from the void.
